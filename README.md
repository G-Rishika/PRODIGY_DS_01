This project, titled Task-01: Global Population Visualization, uses real-time population data from the World Bank API to analyze and visualize global trends. Developed in Python using Google Colab, the notebook showcases the top 10 most populous countries in 2020 and provides a histogram of global population distribution. Libraries like pandas, pandas_datareader, seaborn, and matplotlib were used for data fetching, manipulation, and plotting. One of the key highlights is that no CSV file is required â€” all data is fetched live through API calls. This project is ideal for data science beginners and students looking to understand population insights through clean, visually compelling plots. Future upgrades could include animated population trends across years and continent-level comparisons. This notebook is fully Colab-compatible and structured for smooth walkthroughs or portfolio showcases.
